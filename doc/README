| 1 | Introduction |
+---+--------------+

C-Dogs SDL is a port of a really fun old DOS game to modern operating systems,
using the SDL media libraries for graphics, sound and input (hence the name).

For more information about the original C-Dogs read 'original_readme.txt'.


+---+---------------------+
| 2 | Tested Environments |
+---+---------------------+

C-Dogs SDL has been ported with a Unix development environment.
In theory, C-Dogs SDL could run on any system that is supported by SDL.
See the SDL website - <http://www.libsdl.org> for more about SDL itself.

C-Dogs SDL runs on Linux, *BSD, Windows and Mac OS X.

There are also unofficial ports to GP2X, BeOS/ZETA/Haiku, MorphOS,
Nintendo DS, and AmigaOS 4 to name a few.

See <http://lumaki.com/code/cdogs/download> for a more comprehensive list.

And of course, should you succeed in running C-Dogs SDL on a different
operating system, platform or toaster please contact us! :-)


+---+--------------+
| 3 | Installation |
+---+--------------+

To compile C-Dogs SDL you need to have the SDL libraries previously installed,
the SDL_mixer libraries also installed if you want better sound (and music), and
a compiler (gcc recommended) and the appropriate header files.

See 'INSTALL' for actual installation instructions...


+---+----------------------+
| 4 | Command line options |
+---+----------------------+

The C-Dogs binary is called "cdogs-sdl". Below are some command line arguments:

Video Options:
	-fullscreen	Try and use a fullscreen video mode.
	-scale=n	Scale the window resolution up by a factor of n
			  Factors: 2, 3, 4
	-screen=WxH	Set virtual screen width to W x H
			Modes: 320x200, 320x240, 400x300, 640x480, 800x600
	-forcemode	Don't check video mode sanity

Sound Options:
	-nosound	Disable sound

Control Options:
	-nojoystick	Disable joystick(s)
	-js1threshold=n Joystick 1 threshold.
	-js2threshold=n Joystick 2 threshold.

Game Options:
	-savecampaigns  Save builtin campaigns as in the current directory.
	-wait		Wait for a key hit before initialising video.
	-shakemult=n	Screen shaking multiplier (0 = disable).

	-help		Display command line options and version information.

These can be used in any order/combination:

	$ cdogs-sdl -fullscreen -screen=400x300

Which will make the game try to run fullscreen at 400x300 resolution.
